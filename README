- Backup and restore

# Backup and Restore #
=========================

Configure your project to use gae-backup
=============================================

Modify settings.py

- Modify settings.py to add GAE_BACKUP_MODELS ( tuple of models 
that will be backed) to your application:

Example:

GAE_BACKUP_MODELS = (
    (
          'app1.models', 
          ('app1_model1'.'app1_model2',),
     ),
     (
          'app2.models', 
          ('app2.model1',),
     ),
)

Backup
===========

Run:

 ./gae-backup <application root>
 
 Options:
  -d, --debug           
  -u URL, --url=URL     
  -e EMAIL, --email=EMAIL
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Example:

# Backup development server on localhost 8000

./gae-backup -d  path_to_your_gae_app 

# Backup development server on localhost 8080

./gae-backup -d http://localhost:8080 path_to_your_gae_app 

# Backup deployment server 

./gae-backup path_to_your_gae_app 

Restore
=============

./gae-restore.py path_to_your_gae_app backup_folder

Example

./gae-restore.py -d  path_to_your_gae_app 2009-08-27-21:45


Working Theory
============================

As GAE do not support to assign data entry with numeric ID, the 
ID is generated automatically. Therefore, if entry is backed with 
ID field, it won't be able to restore the record to the same key
unless the original record is existed. But it will fail if it 
is going to restore to a flash application.

In order to overcome the problem, gae-backup will replace numeric
ID to key started with "_" (e.g , ID with 2673 will be converted
to "_2673" ). The reference from other model will also be updated.
That mean you may get a different database after restoration.


Script Laoder
==================

gae-remote-run is a program that could connect to a GAE server,
and load another script for any processing.

Example (remove app1_model1 and app1_model2 from database):

./gae-remote-run.py -d path_to_your_gae_app drop_tables app1.models app1_model1 app1_model2

# drop_tables is a script that will clear all the entry of assigned models.
